# Model Nomination for Malware Detection using Memory Artifacts

## Overview
The project goal is to determine an optimal model and method for the effective classification of malware from memory analysis data captures.

### Note:

- The dataset used for evaluation has not been verified and tested against live data.
- The final results analysis varies due to variation within Random Forest predictions.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used for model estimation is a pre-labeled collection of plugin utility outputs from the Volatility memory analysis framework (ref: https://volatility3.readthedocs.io). The plugins examine patterns to identify locations in memory where process, network, and similar information is stored and return the associated data for analysis. The outputs have been pre-formatted into associated feature columns and encoded in a numeric representation. The features are explained in the following section.
